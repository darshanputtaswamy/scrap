						an ODP(Open distributed processing) system can be described in terms of related, interacting objects. The foundation of the ODP	standards is deked by a set of basic modelling concepts,
						specification concepts and structuring concepts. The basic modelling concepts define the general object-model of ODP and include the notions of object, interface, action and interaction.. The specification concepts define
						elements for reasoning about specifications, including composition, decomposition, type and class, templates and roles. Thms structuring concepts address recurrent structures in distributed systems, e.g. groups, policies,
						naming, behaw'our and communication.

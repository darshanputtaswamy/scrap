Design the simplest, dumbest MMO you can imagine. Say, each player is a little ball rolling around, 
doing absolutely nothing but watch other players. Use, no textures, just solid colors. No lighting, no combat, no interactions.
 Nothing. Simple, right? Now write it, complete it to the point where you can distribute it online and people can install it, 
play with it and report errors. See how that goes. This world is about 3 orders of magnitude simpler than WoW, 
so factor that in and you'll get your answer

9.  How to upload files to FTP site
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 

        Request you to upload all requested files to ftp.oracle.com using ftp.

        FTP IP address: ftp.oracle.com

        USERID: anonymous

        PASSWORD: your_complete_email id (ex: abc@xyz.com - note you need

                                             to ensure '@' is present)

 

        TO UPLOAD FILES:

 

        1. Change to directory, for example:

        ftp> cd support/incoming

        (Or may use your competency/incoming, ie, apps, svrtech, etc)

        2. Make a directory named with your current tar number:

        ftp> mkdir <SR#>

        3. Change into that new directory:

        ftp> cd <SR#>

        4. Set the transfer type to binary

        ftp> binary [or bin]

        5. Upload the files

        ftp> put file_name or mput *

 

        Please note that uploading a file in this fashion does not notify the analyst.

        So, you must update the SR with the full directory path where you have uploaded the file(s) so that the analyst assigned to your SR can

        retrieve the files.

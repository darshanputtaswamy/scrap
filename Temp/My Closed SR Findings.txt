Bug 17666234 : TAIL -F COMMAND ON ACFS GOT ERROR
Check the Linux version and tail --version

Data to collection
---------------------
1] strace of tail command
2]  cat /etc/redhat-release
3] uname -a


The error that you are seeing :

" tail: unrecognized file system type 0x61636673 for `FULL_DB_BKP_030614134616.log'. Reverting to polling.".

This is due to the the kernel coreutils missing the acfs magic number ie 61636673 ( In ASCII is 'acfs').
There seems to be issues with the version of coreutils that encountered similar errors on several fS.

There is a bug filed for the same issue Bug 17666234 - TAIL -F COMMAND ON ACFS GOT ERROR, which is with development.

Please provide me with the following :

tail --version

rpm -qa | grep coreutils
